# tiny-aes package

Enables AES encryption and decryption of text as in the TextMate text bundle.

Currently, this package depends on the OSX command line, but the goal is eventually to write everything in pure Javascript.

### Todo

- submit it using git
  - update the git entry in package.json
- branch it to start working on the dialog box (polymer?)
- use javascript-compatiable aes library
- publish the encryption package (with dependency to dialog package)
